# Text-Classification-Module

This repo is the compilation of different text classification algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Network and Hierarchial Attention Network.

Also, this repo have two different implementations for the text classification algorithms, one in tensorflow and other in Keras.
